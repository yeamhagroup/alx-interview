# 0x01. Lockboxes
## üí° idea

Imagine you have a bunch of boxes that are locked with different keys. Each box has a number on it, from 0 to n - 1, where n is the total number of boxes. For example, if you have 5 boxes, they will be numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.

Inside each box, there may be some keys that can open other boxes. The keys also have numbers on them, and they match the numbers of the boxes they can open. For example, if you find a key with number 2 inside box 0, that means you can use that key to open box 2.

However, not every box has a key inside it, and not every key has a matching box. For example, you may find a key with number 6 inside box 1, but there is no box 6. Or you may find an empty box with no keys inside it.

You start with the first box (box 0) already unlocked. You want to know if you can open all the other boxes using the keys you find inside the boxes.

To answer this question, you need to write a method (a piece of code) that takes the list of boxes as an input and returns True or False as an output. The input will be a list of lists, where each sublist represents the keys inside a box. For example, [[1], [2], [3], [4], []] means that box 0 has a key for box 1, box 1 has a key for box 2, and so on until box 4 which is empty.

The method should return True if you can open all the boxes using the keys you find inside them. Otherwise, it should return False. For example, for the input [[1], [2], [3], [4], []], the method should return True because you can open all the boxes in order. But for the input [[1, 3], [3, 0], [2], [0], []], the method should return False because you cannot open box 4.

## üìù instructions

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

- Prototype: `def canUnlockAll(boxes)`
- `boxes` is a list of lists
- A key with the same number as a box opens that box
